title: About me

Hi, my name is esio, I'm a software developer and system administrator.

I live in Poland with my wife and two Siberian Forest Cats.

I'm interested in big, scallable and high avability systems.

Currently I'm working as a DevOps engineer in Intel Corporation focues on Continous Integration and Continous Delivery process for big software project.
Additionally I'm responsible for an infrastructure and lab operations.

During my career I was a PLC programmer and electrionic circuit designer for a while. In 2010 I switched to IT and started my career as Unix system administrator in the biggers polish internet portal. I have an experience as low level C++ developer.

In free time I run my own software project - <a href="esioci.github.io">esioci</a>. This is my traverse for new technologies and things (like microservices, new programming languages, etc.). 
Currently (autumn 2016) application contains backend written in Elixir programming languages (I'm tryining to approach functional programming paradigm), VUE.js frontend library and small support microservice in golang.

I'm trying to stay up to date to industry and develop new approach by myself. I have a lot of personal project for testing purpose (e.g. Android app in C++, some Ruby applications, haskell, scala, etc.).

I like music (I'm trumphet player), running, cycling, history (XIX and XX cenury) and books.
